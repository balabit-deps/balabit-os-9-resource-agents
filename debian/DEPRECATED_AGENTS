# Deprecated agents

All the agents listed below are no longer maintained upstream and their use is
discouraged. They might be removed in future releases.

* Evmsd: EVMS is no longer actively maintained and should not be used.
* EvmsSCC: EVMS is no longer actively maintained and should not be used.
* LinuxSCSI: This agent makes use of Linux SCSI hot-plug functionality which has
  been superseded by SCSI reservations.
* pingd: It was superseded by ocf:pacemaker:pingd.
* scsi2reservation: It depends on scsi_reserve which is not supported
  (SCSI-2 reservation is not supported, please use SCSI-3 reservation. That can
  be achieved with the sg_persist resource agent)
